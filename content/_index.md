Hello there! I'm Xavier, I work with hardware, fimware and software. I'm currently working at HOP TECH as a firmware developer. I sometime write my experiences and thoughts on my [blog](./blog).

I'm interested in firmware, reproductable build and tooling. My current tools of choice are Rust and Nix.
