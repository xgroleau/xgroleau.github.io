Hello there! I'm Xavier, I work with hardware, firmware and software. I'm currently working at HOP TECH as a firmware developer.
Sometimes I write my experiences and thoughts on my [blog](./blog).

I'm interested in firmware, infrastructure, reproducible builds and tooling. My current tools of choice are Rust and Nix.
